# review-fix-summary

PR Number: $ARGUMENTS

## Goal
After addressing all issues from a code review, generate a structured fix report
that summarises what was resolved and confirms the PR is ready for re-review.
Persist only a temporary working file under `.openspec-cli/` (GitHub is the archive).

## Pre-flight checklist

1. Read the original review at `.openspec-cli/.review-output.md` or
   `.openspec-cli/.review-output.md.applied` (and/or the GitHub PR review comment)
2. Read `openspec/config.yaml` — active stack, tooling commands
3. Verify current test status: `{{test_command}}`
4. Verify coverage: `{{coverage_command}}`

## Process

1. Go through each CRITICAL and MAJOR issue from the original review
2. For each issue, confirm the fix is in place (read the relevant code)
3. Note MINOR issues that were also addressed
4. Note any issues intentionally deferred, with justification
5. Record test and coverage results
6. Emit a final verdict: READY FOR RE-REVIEW / NEEDS FURTHER WORK
7. **Save the report** to `.openspec-cli/.fix-report.md` (do **not** create
   folders under `ai-specs/changes/reviews/`)

## Language

Write the entire report (including section headers) in the Active Language from the prompt.

## Output format

Save a markdown file at `.openspec-cli/.fix-report.md` with this structure
(translate headers when Active Language is Spanish):
