# OpenSpec Developer — Spec-Driven AI Development Platform

OpenSpec connects your project management tool (Jira), your codebase, and your AI agent
(Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) into a single coherent workflow — driven by specs
and standards, not by improvisation.

> **This is the developer edition.** It ships with stacks for Java, Python, Node.js, Go,
> React, and Angular. For the Thought Machine Vault Smart Contracts stack, see the
> `spec-driven-project` repository.

## The Problem

Modern development teams using AI assistants face a recurring gap: the AI knows
how to code, but it doesn't know *your* project. It doesn't know your architecture,
your conventions, your Jira tickets, or your stack. Every prompt has to re-explain
context that already exists somewhere — scattered across Jira, README files,
and tribal knowledge.

The result: AI output that's generic, inconsistent, and requires heavy review
and rework before it fits your codebase.

---

## The Solution

OpenSpec acts as the bridge. It stores your project's architectural decisions,
stack conventions, and quality standards as structured spec files. A lightweight
CLI reads those specs, fetches context from Jira, and builds a complete,
context-rich prompt — then delivers it to whatever AI agent your team uses.

```
Jira Ticket
    +
Project Specs (architecture, standards, conventions)
    +
Active Stack (Java, Python, Node, Go, Angular, React)
    +
Active AI Agent (Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, Aider)
    ↓
One CLI command
    ↓
Context-rich prompt → AI generates plan / implementation / review
```

---

## Core Concepts

### Spec-Driven Development
All architectural decisions live in `ai-specs/specs/`. Agents read these
before generating any output. The AI always works within your conventions —
not against them.

### Multi-Stack Support
One repo can support multiple technology stacks. Switch between them with
`os-stack <name>`. The active stack determines which agent file, standards,
and tooling commands are loaded.

### Multi-Agent Support
Works with any AI agent. Switch between them with `os-agent <name>`.
Clipboard agents (Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf) copy prompts for manual paste.
CLI agents (Claude Code, Aider) send prompts automatically via terminal.

### Jira Integration
Every command that generates a prompt starts by fetching the real ticket
from Jira — title, description, status, assignee. No copy-pasting context.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install the CLI
sh .openspec-cli/install.sh
source ~/.bashrc

# 2. Configure credentials
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: JIRA_BASE_URL, JIRA_EMAIL, JIRA_TOKEN
gh auth login

# 3. Select your stack and agent
os-stack --list
os-stack python-fastapi
os-agent --list
os-agent copilot

# 4. Start with a ticket
os-enrich KAN-1          # enrich ticket with technical detail
os-plan KAN-1            # generate implementation plan
os-develop KAN-1         # create branch + implementation
os-commit KAN-1          # commit + PR
os-review 1              # AI code review
os-review-apply 1        # publish review to GitHub
```

## Architecture Principles

OpenSpec enforces these principles across all stacks:

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** — Domain, Application, Presentation layers
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** — tests before implementation, always
- **90% coverage threshold** — enforced per stack
- **English only** — all code, comments, docs, and commits
- **Conventional commits** — `feat`, `fix`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`
- **No secrets in code** — environment variables only

---

## Contributing

1. Pick a ticket from Jira
2. Run `os-enrich <TICKET-ID>` to add technical detail
3. Run `os-plan <TICKET-ID>` to generate the implementation plan
4. Run `os-develop <TICKET-ID>` to implement
5. Run `os-commit <TICKET-ID>` to open a PR
6. Request review — `os-review <PR>` generates an AI code review
